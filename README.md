# two-trees

are a [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) inspired virtual dom and a 'virtual data object model' ;-).  
Both trees encapsulate either your view or your data with a node structure.  
You can create components to use with the view-tree and the data-tree has build in undo/redo functionality.  
  
This project is under development. Play with it but use it on your own risk.  
<br/>

**usage**
```text
    
    npm install two-trees --save
    
    # or (better for now)
     
    git clone https://github.com/jarends/two-trees.git 
      
```
  
<br/>  
  
Until now you have to look into the little [example](https://github.com/jarends/two-trees/tree/master/example/) to get a feeling, how it works.  
And the working example can be found here: https://jarends.github.io/two-trees/

Enjoy!
